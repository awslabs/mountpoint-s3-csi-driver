// WIP: Part of https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3-csi-driver/issues/279.
//
// `aws-s3-csi-mounter` is the entrypoint binary running on Mountpoint Pods.
// It is responsible for receiving mount options from the CSI Driver Node Pod,
// and spawning a Mountpoint instance in turn.
// It will then wait until Mountpoint process terminates (which normally happens as a result of `unmount`).
