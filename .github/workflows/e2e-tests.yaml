# This workflow runs e2e tests and relies on existance of EKS cluster with a `s3-csi-driver-sa` service account
# already deployed to it, which provides the driver with access to s3.
#
# Since we have a single cluster for e2e tests, we ensure that no more than one instance of this workflow is
# running by `concurrency: e2e-cluster` option.
#
# Succesfull workflows triggered by push to main will upload tested image to the private repository "PROMOTED_IMAGE_NAME":
# - uploaded images will be tagged with main branch commit number
# - uploaded images will be later promoted to public repository by "release" workflow
